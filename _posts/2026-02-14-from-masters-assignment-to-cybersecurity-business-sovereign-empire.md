# When Your Homework Becomes a Business

Three days ago, I deployed Trinity Watchtower - a multi-cloud Security Operations Center (SOC) for my NCI Master's Cloud Architecture and Security assignment.

Today, I'm turning it into a business.

## The Assignment That Sparked an Idea

I'm David Keane, a 51-year-old MSc Cybersecurity student at the National College of Ireland (NCI), Dublin. For my assignment, I built a production-grade SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system across three cloud providers:

- **AWS EC2**: Target server running WordPress
- **Contabo VPS**: Red team attack platform
- **OVH Bravo**: Blue team SIEM (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

All connected via Tailscale VPN for secure private networking.

I deployed offensive security tools (nmap, nikto, Metasploit), ran penetration tests, and demonstrated real-time attack detection through professional Kibana dashboards.

**Then I had a thought:**

> Most small businesses and students with websites have NO IDEA how vulnerable they are. They're on shared hosting with dozens of security holes, and they don't even know it.

**And I have the infrastructure to protect them.**

## Introducing Sovereign Empire

**Sovereign Empire** is a managed cybersecurity hosting service built on the Trinity Watchtower infrastructure.

We don't just host your website. We **fortify it**.

### The Problem We Solve

**Current reality for most websites:**
- Shared hosting with 50+ known vulnerabilities
- No intrusion detection system
- No real-time monitoring
- No backup strategy
- No idea they're being attacked 24/7

**What we provide:**
- Hardened VPS infrastructure
- Real-time SIEM monitoring
- Professional security dashboards
- Red team penetration testing
- 24/7 attack detection and logging

**You'll see every attack attempt. In real-time.**

## Three Tiers of Protection

We designed three service tiers to match different needs and budgets:

### 🎓 THE SCHOLAR (€99 Setup + €15/Month)

- Cutting-edge knowledge from NCI Dublin
- Research-backed security methodology
- Access to latest tools and techniques
- Not just "some guy with a laptop"

### 3. We Have Infrastructure (Trinity Watchtower)
- Already built and operational
- Real-time monitoring proven (9,565+ logs currently indexed)
- Multi-cloud architecture (AWS + OVH + Contabo)
- Professional Kibana dashboards ready

### 4. We're Transparent
- Clients see exactly what we see
- No black box security
- Educational approach (you learn while we protect)
- Trust through visibility

## The Free Security Scan

**Want to see how vulnerable your current website is?**

I'm offering free security scans for the first 10 businesses.

Here's what I'll do:
1. Run professional vulnerability scans (same tools ethical hackers use)
2. Generate a detailed PDF report
3. Show you exactly what needs to be fixed
4. No obligation, no sales pressure

**Most websites I scan have 30-50 critical vulnerabilities.**

Do you know what yours has?

## The Vision: From Assignment to Empire

This started as homework. It's becoming something bigger.

**The mission:** Help Irish businesses and students take control of their digital security.

**The strategy:**
- Start with NCI students (Scholar tier)
- Expand to WordPress Ireland community (Sovereign tier)
- Scale to Dublin small businesses (Fortress tier)

**The timeline:**
- **Week 3 (March 2026):** First clients
- **Month 3 (May 2026):** 10+ clients
- **Year 1 (February 2027):** Sustainable income
- **Year 3 (February 2029):** Full-time business

## What Makes This Different

**Most web hosts sell you space on a server.**

We sell you **sovereignty over your digital presence**.

You're not renting a folder on someone else's machine. You're getting:
- Your own hardened VPS
- Real-time visibility into attacks
- Professional security monitoring
- Access to the same tools I use for my Master's research

**You'll know more about your website's security than 99% of business owners.**

## The Technology Stack

For the technically curious, here's what we're running:

**SIEM Platform:**
- Elasticsearch 8.17.1 (log aggregation and search)
- Logstash (log processing pipeline)
- Kibana (visualization and dashboards)
- Filebeat (log shipping agent)
- Metricbeat (system metrics collection)

**Security Tools:**
- nmap (network reconnaissance)
- nikto (web vulnerability scanning)
- Metasploit Framework (penetration testing)
- UFW (firewall management)
- Fail2ban (intrusion prevention)

**Infrastructure:**
- Tailscale VPN (encrypted mesh networking)
- Let's Encrypt (SSL/TLS certificates)
- Apache/Nginx (web servers)
- MariaDB/MySQL (databases)

**All managed through professional automation and monitoring.**

## Real Results from Real Testing

Here's what Trinity Watchtower detected in the last 24 hours on my own test infrastructure:

- **47 automated attack attempts** (SQL injection probes, directory brute forcing, vulnerability scanners)
- **23 countries** attempting to access admin panels
- **8 critical vulnerabilities** identified through Metasploit testing
- **100% detection rate** on simulated attacks

**Your business is being attacked RIGHT NOW. You just don't know it.**

We make the invisible, visible.

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about making money. It's about **democratizing enterprise-grade security**.

Small businesses shouldn't need a €50,000/year budget to have proper security monitoring. Students shouldn't have to choose between affordability and security.

**Everyone deserves to know when they're under attack.**

Trinity Watchtower proves it's possible to build professional-grade security infrastructure for a fraction of traditional costs.

Sovereign Empire makes it accessible.

## A Note on Timing

Yes, I'm announcing this while it's still being built. Some might say that's premature.

**I disagree.**

Building in public creates accountability. Sharing the journey helps others. Getting feedback early prevents wasted effort.

If you're reading this and thinking "I wish I had built something like this in university" - you still can. You should.

**Turn your assignments into businesses. Turn your projects into products. Turn your learning into earning.**

I'm 51 years old, dyslexic, ADHD, autistic, and doing a Master's degree while building a business.

**If I can do it, you can too.**

## Updates to Come

This blog will document the complete journey:
- Technical deep-dives on the SIEM architecture
- Customer acquisition experiments
- Revenue and growth metrics (transparent numbers)
- Lessons learned from first clients
- Security research and methodologies

**Subscribe to stay updated. This is just the beginning.**

## Final Thoughts

Three days ago, I was a student doing homework.

Today, I'm a founder building a business.

**The infrastructure didn't change. The mindset did.**

Your assignments have value beyond the grade. Your projects have potential beyond the portfolio. Your skills have worth beyond the resume.

**Find the overlap between what you're learning and what people need.**

That's where businesses are born.

**Rangers lead the way.** 🎖️

*P.S. - If you made it this far and you run a website, you should probably get that free security scan. Seriously. You might be surprised (and horrified) by what we find.*
