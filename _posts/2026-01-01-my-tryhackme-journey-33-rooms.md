## My Favourite Rooms

### 1. Mr Robot CTF
Based on the TV show! This room taught me real enumeration and exploitation techniques. Finding that first shell was incredibly satisfying.

### 2. Advent of Cyber
25 days of challenges covering everything from web exploitation to forensics. Perfect for building a broad skill set.

### 3. Google Dorking
Mind-blowing how much you can find with the right search queries. Essential OSINT skill.

## What's Next?

For 2026, my goals are:

- [ ] Complete 100 rooms

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Start with fundamentals** - Linux Fundamentals trilogy is essential
2. **Don't skip the "easy" rooms** - They build important foundations
3. **Take notes** - I use Obsidian to document everything
4. **Join the community** - Discord is great for hints without spoilers
5. **Consistency beats intensity** - 1 hour daily > 10 hours once a week
